Learned counsel appearing for the appellant, however, contended before us that PW.2 in her sta

sleeping inside the house whereas in his evidence he had stated that they were sleeping in the

Court hence should not be believed. This argument was not raised before the courts below. Be
 that as it may, we consider that there is hardly any improvement in the statement as per D1 a

stated that when she came near his husband accused persons ran away, whereas in the statement
before the investigating officer she had stated that when she came out on seeing the attack on
 her husband, on seeing these witnesses all the accused ran away. This is hardly any improv
ement in the fact is that this witness had seen A1 and identified him be it while attacking or
 running away thereafter. PW.3 who as per D2 allegedly stated before the investigating officer
 that at the time of incident he was sleeping inside the house and in his evidence he had sta

so because it is the statement of this witness he was sleeping separately from his father

"on 1st January, 1993
when the appellant entered the house of the deceased Sule
Bai at about 11 pm and attempted to outrage her modesty and
when she objected to his behavior he took out a matchbox
from his pocket, lighted a matchstick and then threw it on
her saree which caught fire causing 37% burn injuries. On

also convened in the village the very next morning and the
appellant was directed to make arrangements for medical aid
to the victim, but he did not make any effort in that
direction till the 5th January, 1993. As a consequence, the
injuries suffered by her and complicated by the lack of
medical care, Sule Bai ultimately died one month and 18 days
after the incident. It has accordingly been argued by Mr.K.
Priyadarshi, the learned counsel for the appellant, that no

case under Section 302 IPC was made against him and that the
matter would fall within Section 304 (I) of the IPC as he
had only thrown a lighted match stick at her, which act did
not constitute an intention to commit murder. He has also
pointed out that the appellant was unaware of the fact that
the victim was wearing garments of inflammable material. The
prosecution story, however, is that a meeting had been
convened on the morning of the 2nd January, 1993, in which
the appellant had undertaken to provide complete medical aid
to Sule Bai but as per the evidence, no aid was provided by
him till the 5th January, 1993. It is, therefore, obvious
that the intention of the appellant that the victim should
die was writ large in the facts of the case. The argument
that the matter would fall under Section 304 (1) IPC, thus,
cannot be accepted.",murder

that as it may, we consider that there is hardly any improvement in the statement as per D1 a

stated that when she came near his husband accused persons ran away, whereas in the statement

that at the time of incident he was sleeping inside the house and in his evidence he had sta

"Surjit Kaur died within a period of two and a half years 
of her marriage on 18th March, 1995 on a date when she had planned to 
celebrate the birth of her one year old child and had invited her 
parents and other family members to also attend the said function. 
The husband of deceased Surjit Kaur was working as a truck driver. 
Her father-in-law was a retired army man and the father of the father- 
in-law was also alive and present. Appellant Manjit Kaur claims that 
she was working as a teacher and that at the relevant time, she had 
not been present at home. Smt. Surjit Kaur had suddenly fallen sick 
and thus she had been taken to the hospital, where she was declared as 
brought dead. The dead body was taken back to her house. Her parents 
were also informed on her death by the appellant Jagninder Singh and 
on the same day, an FIR was lodged by the father of deceased Surjit 
Kaur. The Police recovered the dead body, prepared the panchanama 
and sent the body of Surjit Kaur for post-morterm examination. The 
matter was investigated and charge-sheet was filed against the 
appellants. The appellants were charged under Section 498A and 304B 
IPC. The prosecution examined a large number of witnesses including 
Dr. Baldev Singh, PW 1 who had conducted the post-morterm examination.",murder
"Brief history of the case is that on 7th June, 2000 at about 
7.30 p.m., the appellant (Accused No. 1) along with six other 
accused, in pursuit of their common object of committing dacoity, 
followed the deceased Ganapathy and his son (defacto complainant 
--PW 1) in a Maruthi van while the deceased and his son were going 
home from their jewellery shop carrying with them gold ornaments 
weighing about 1= kg on a scooter. All the accused, in furtherance of 
their common intention of dacoity, intercepted the deceased and his 
2 
son with such force which capsized their scooter and they fell down 
on the ground. While the defacto complainant (son of the deceased 
--PW 1) ran away with the jewellery bag crying for help from the 
vicinity, the accused Nos. 1 and 2 caught hold of the deceased and 
stabbed him with a knife on his chest, back and neck inflicting fatal 
injuries to which the victim Ganapathy (deceased) succumbed on the 
way to Government Hospital. 
3. The Trial Court, after analyzing the entire evidence of 
prosecution witnesses coupled with the appreciation of material 
evidence, came to the conclusion that the accused No.1 (appellant 
herein) and accused No. 2 have played vital role in the crime as they 
have aimed to commit dacoity and upon failure in their attempt, they 
committed the murder.",murder
"The cold evening of Delhi on 16 th 
December, 2012 could not have 
even remotely planted the feeling in the twenty-three year old lady, a 
para-medical student, who had gone with her friend to watch a film at 
PVR Select City Walk Mall, Saket, that in the next few hours, the 
shattering cold night that was gradually stepping in would bring with 
it the devastating hour of darkness when she, alongwith her friend, 
would get into a bus at Munirka bus stand to be dropped at a 
particular place; and possibly could not have imagined that she would 
2 
be a prey to the savage lust of a gang of six, face brutal assault 
and 
become a playful thing that could be tossed around at their wild whim 
and her private parts would be ruptured to give vent to their pervert 
sexual appetite, unthinkable and sadistic pleasure. What the victims 
had not conceived of, it all happened, as the chronology of events 
would unroll. The attitude, perception, the beastial proclivity, 
inconceivable self-obsession and individual centralism of the six made 
the young lady to suffer immense trauma and, in the ultimate 
eventuate, the life-spark that moves the bodily frame got extinguished 
in spite of availing of all the possible treatment that the medical world 
could provide. The death took place at a hospital in Singapore where 
she had been taken to with the hope that her life could be saved. 
2. The friend of the girl survived in spite of being thrown outside the 
bus along with the girl and the attempt of the accused-appellants to 
run over them became futile as they, by their slight movement, could 
escape from being crushed under the bus, and the appellants left 
them thinking that they were no more alive. Lying naked, as the 
clothes were removed from their bodies, they shouted for help and as 
good fortune would have it, the night patrolling vehicle, a motor cycle, 
arrived and the said man, Raj Kumar, PW-72, gave the shirt to the boy 
and contacted the control room from which a Bolero patrol van came 
and they brought a bed sheet and tore it into two parts and gave a 
3 
piece to each of the victims so that they could cover themselves and 
feel civil. The PCR van took the victims to the Safdarjung Hospital 
where treatment commenced.",murder
