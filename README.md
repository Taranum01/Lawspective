# Lawspective- Your legal Consultancy

In the judicial system, the scope of work with text documents is very significant, 
and the decision-making process must always be fair and transparent. Manually processing such information is very difficult and sometimes almost impossible. 
In addition, people without legal education and involved in the trial face various issues that are difficult to solve without legal assistance. 

This project aims at resolving these issues by creating a machine learning model which will Automatically Identify Charges based on the facts of a situation 
and match these charges to the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. 
This tool will be helpful for lawyers, judges, police, public prosecutors and law students by acting as a legal assistant 
and giving them an accurate overview of the situation in a legal capacity.  Its user-friendly dynamic will make this tool handy for the general public as well.
