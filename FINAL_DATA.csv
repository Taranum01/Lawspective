 about Jyoti and he had not taken her alongwith him for
 visiting cinema. Thereafter, PW-1 and other family members

 was tried and convicted as stated above. Other accused was
 acquitted by the Addl.Sessions Judge. The Sessions court
 relied on the evidence of PW-6 Vimla, daughter-in-law of
 PW-1, PW-4 Ravi, nephew of PW-1 and PW-5 child witness and
 held that deceased had gone with the accused after coming
 from the school. Thereafter, her dead body was found the
 next day at 9 a.m. During the aforesaid evidence as well
 as medical evidence the court also considered the evidence
 of PW-8 Dr.Smt. S.Thakur who carried out post mortem
 examination. She has noticed that deceased was in a school
 uniform. She has also stated and three doctors who had
 examined the dead body, arrived at the conclusion that rape

however he performed a marriage with Indramma co-accused,

became unpleasant and Jayanthi was often assaulted and was
made to do all the household chores and was also compelled

ed nearly 25 injuries consequent to which the deceased died. The incident in
question was seen by PW.2 and PW.3, being the wife and son-in-law respectively of the deceased

 and based conviction on their evidence.
Learned counsel appearing for the appellant, however, contended before us that PW.2 in her sta
tement before the police which is on record as Exh.D.1 had stated that the accused persons had
 run away when she came to the scene of the incident therefore there is an improvement in her
evidence, and PW.3 as per Exh.D2 had stated before the police that at the time of the
incident he and other family members were

sleeping inside the house whereas in his evidence he had stated that they were sleeping in the
 Varandah hence there is a serious contradiction and improvement in his statement before the
Court hence should not be believed. This argument was not raised before the courts below. Be
 that as it may, we consider that there is hardly any improvement in the statement as per D1 a
nd D2 in their statements before the court. As per PW.1â€™s statement before the police she had
stated that when she came near his husband accused persons ran away, whereas in the statement
before the investigating officer she had stated that when she came out on seeing the attack on
 her husband, on seeing these witnesses all the accused ran away. This is hardly any improv
ement in the fact is that this witness had seen A1 and identified him be it while attacking or
 running away thereafter. PW.3 who as per D2 allegedly stated before the investigating officer
 that at the time of incident he was sleeping inside the house and in his evidence he had sta
ted that he was sleeping in the Varandah. We find hardly difference in these two statements al
so because it is the statement of this witness he was sleeping separately from his father

the appellant had undertaken to provide complete medical aid
to Sule Bai but as per the evidence, no aid was provided by
him till the 5th January, 1993. It is, therefore, obvious

held that deceased had gone with the accused after coming 
from the school. Thereafter, her dead body was found the

ed nearly 25 injuries consequent to which the deceased died. The incident in 
question was seen by PW.2 and PW.3, being the wife and son-in-law respectively of the deceased

and based conviction on their evidence. 
Learned counsel appearing for the appellant, however, contended before us that PW.2 in her sta 
tement before the police which is on record as Exh.D.1 had stated that the accused persons had 
run away when she came to the scene of the incident therefore there is an improvement in her 
evidence, and PW.3 as per Exh.D2 had stated before the police that at the time of the 
incident he and other family members were

sleeping inside the house whereas in his evidence he had stated that they were sleeping in the 
Varandah hence there is a serious contradiction and improvement in his statement before the 
Court hence should not be believed. This argument was not raised before the courts below. Be 
that as it may, we consider that there is hardly any improvement in the statement as per D1 a 
nd D2 in their statements before the court. As per PW.1’s statement before the police she had 
stated that when she came near his husband accused persons ran away, whereas in the statement 
before the investigating officer she had stated that when she came out on seeing the attack on 
her husband, on seeing these witnesses all the accused ran away. This is hardly any improv 
ement in the fact is that this witness had seen A1 and identified him be it while attacking or 
running away thereafter. PW.3 who as per D2 allegedly stated before the investigating officer 
that at the time of incident he was sleeping inside the house and in his evidence he had sta 
ted that he was sleeping in the Varandah. We find hardly difference in these two statements al 
so because it is the statement of this witness he was sleeping separately from his father

when the appellant entered the house of the deceased Sule 
Bai at about 11 pm and attempted to outrage her modesty and 
when she objected to his behavior he took out a matchbox

her saree which caught fire causing 37% burn injuries. On

pointed out that the appellant was unaware of the fact that 
the victim was wearing garments of inflammable material. The 
prosecution story, however, is that a meeting had been

the appellant had undertaken to provide complete medical aid 
to Sule Bai but as per the evidence, no aid was provided by 
him till the 5th January, 1993. It is, therefore, obvious 
that the intention of the appellant that the victim should

cannot be accepted.",murder,january appellant entered house deceased sule bai pm attempted outrage modesty objected behavior took matchbox pocket lighted matchstick threw saree caught fire causing burn injury hearing sule bai cry several person came spot extinguished fire using water meeting also convened village next morning appellant directed make arrangement medical aid victim not make effort direction till january consequence injury suffered complicated lack medical care sule bai ultimately died one month day incident accordingly argued mr k priyadarshi learned counsel appellant case section ipc made matter would fall within section ipc thrown lighted match stick act not constitute intention commit murder also pointed appellant unaware fact victim wearing garment inflammable material prosecution story however meeting convened morning january appellant undertaken provide complete medical aid sule bai per evidence aid provided till january therefore obvious intention appellant victim die writ large fact case argument matter would fall section ipc thus not accepted

"The cold evening of Delhi on 16 th 
December, 2012 could not have 
even remotely planted the feeling in the twenty-three year old lady, a 
para-medical student, who had gone with her friend to watch a film at 
PVR Select City Walk Mall, Saket, that in the next few hours, the 
shattering cold night that was gradually stepping in would bring with 
it the devastating hour of darkness when she, alongwith her friend, 
would get into a bus at Munirka bus stand to be dropped at a 
particular place; and possibly could not have imagined that she would 
2 
be a prey to the savage lust of a gang of six, face brutal assault 
and 
become a playful thing that could be tossed around at their wild whim 
and her private parts would be ruptured to give vent to their pervert 
sexual appetite, unthinkable and sadistic pleasure. What the victims 
had not conceived of, it all happened, as the chronology of events 
would unroll. The attitude, perception, the beastial proclivity, 
inconceivable self-obsession and individual centralism of the six made 
the young lady to suffer immense trauma and, in the ultimate 
eventuate, the life-spark that moves the bodily frame got extinguished 
in spite of availing of all the possible treatment that the medical world 
could provide. The death took place at a hospital in Singapore where 
she had been taken to with the hope that her life could be saved. 
2. The friend of the girl survived in spite of being thrown outside the 
bus along with the girl and the attempt of the accused-appellants to 
run over them became futile as they, by their slight movement, could 
escape from being crushed under the bus, and the appellants left 
them thinking that they were no more alive. Lying naked, as the 
clothes were removed from their bodies, they shouted for help and as 
good fortune would have it, the night patrolling vehicle, a motor cycle, 
arrived and the said man, Raj Kumar, PW-72, gave the shirt to the boy 
and contacted the control room from which a Bolero patrol van came 
and they brought a bed sheet and tore it into two parts and gave a 
3 
piece to each of the victims so that they could cover themselves and 
feel civil. The PCR van took the victims to the Safdarjung Hospital 
where treatment commenced.",murder,cold evening delhi th december could not even remotely planted feeling twenty three year old lady para medical student gone friend watch film pvr select city walk mall saket next hour shattering cold night gradually stepping would bring devastating hour darkness alongwith friend would get bus munirka bus stand dropped particular place possibly could not imagined would prey savage lust gang six face brutal assault become playful thing could tossed around wild whim private part would ruptured give vent pervert sexual appetite unthinkable sadistic pleasure victim not conceived happened chronology event would unroll attitude perception beastial proclivity inconceivable self obsession individual centralism six made young lady suffer immense trauma ultimate eventuate life spark move bodily frame got extinguished spite availing possible treatment medical world could provide death took place hospital singapore taken hope life could saved friend girl survived spite thrown outside bus along girl attempt accused appellant run became futile slight movement could escape crushed bus appellant left thinking alive lying naked clothes removed body shouted help good fortune would night patrolling vehicle motor cycle arrived said man raj kumar pw gave shirt boy contacted control room bolero patrol van came brought bed sheet tore two part gave piece victim could cover feel civil pcr van took victim safdarjung hospital treatment commenced
